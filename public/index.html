	0x06 — why I&rsquo;ve been gone It’s been a while&hellip; Yeah, I know. So&hellip; where were we? I think I fell into a black hole somewhere around mid-2024. Climbing out now, coffee in hand.. If you’re wondering what happened — I did my A/L exam. Yep, That was the boss battle of 2024. Spoiler: I made it out alive
The results came out last week, and I actually did well enough to get into a government uni.&hellip;

	0x05 — you won&rsquo;t see me for a year or two Just a quick note if you’ve been reading along, this has always been a personal blog. Lately, it&rsquo;s been all programming talk, but I’m feeling like it’s time to slow down and shift focus a bit There’s something important I need to give my full attention to&hellip; something that’s been quietly building in the background for a while now. It’s not burnout, and it’s not goodbye&hellip; just a pause while I try to give this next chapter the space it deserves.&hellip;

	0x04 — systemdo or systemdon&rsquo;t Sometimes in the *nix community, people will tell you things like &ldquo;systemd is bad&rdquo; and you shouldn&rsquo;t use it.
After that, they will bandy reasons why systemd is considered to be problematic.
For any normal or informed user, some of the arguments against systemd may hold some validity.
However, for users unfamiliar with nix, these are misleading justifications for not utilizing systemd.
This blog entry is specifically targeted towards the latter crowd.&hellip;

	0x03 — a love letter to forums Time goes on, technology advances, but when I was younger, I was captivated by forums.
I don&rsquo;t know the particulars of it, but there&rsquo;s a strange sense of satisfaction in posting on a board and repeatedly refreshing the page until someone responds.
That&rsquo;s something that nowadays technology has taken from us.
Why would people want to engage in a forum, create a post seeking assistance or initiating a discussion when they can go on Discord and get a response near instantly?&hellip;

	0x02 —__always_inline, linux If you&rsquo;re attempting to install a non-glibc Linux distribution using a Linux 5.X kernel, you&rsquo;ll encounter this error while building the kernel.
/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h:44:8: error: unknown type name '__always_inline'
On a system running glibc, normally this isn&rsquo;t an issue; __always_inline is defined. However, this is not the situation on most systems that utilize musl or other libc libraries.
So, as a quick fix, open up /usr/include/linux/swab.h in your flavor of text editor, and include linux/stddef.&hellip;

	0x01 — Hello, World! This is my little corner of the internet, where I usually write whatever comes to my mind&hellip; a little about me, the work I do, my system, etc.
I&rsquo;m Senath, I go by Dragnosmz on the internet. I&rsquo;m from Sri Lanka.
I&rsquo;m quite obviously a programmer. I code some random things when I feel like it. Occasionally, I dabble in sysadmin stuff.
I remember spending (too) many hours on it watching YouTube, ricing, updating configurations, gaming and God knows what else.&hellip;
