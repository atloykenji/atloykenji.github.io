      <description>0x05 — you won&amp;rsquo;t see me for a year or two Just a quick note if you’ve been reading along, this has always been a personal blog. Lately, it&amp;rsquo;s been all programming talk, but I’m feeling like it’s time to slow down and shift focus a bit There’s something important I need to give my full attention to&amp;hellip; something that’s been quietly building in the background for a while now. It’s not burnout, and it’s not goodbye&amp;hellip; just a pause while I try to give this next chapter the space it deserves.</description>

      <description>0x04 — systemdo or systemdon&amp;rsquo;t Sometimes in the *nix community, people will tell you things like &amp;ldquo;systemd is bad&amp;rdquo; and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use it.&#xA;After that, they will bandy reasons why systemd is considered to be problematic.&#xA;For any normal or informed user, some of the arguments against systemd may hold some validity.&#xA;However, for users unfamiliar with nix, these are misleading justifications for not utilizing systemd.&#xA;This blog entry is specifically targeted towards the latter crowd.</description>

      <description>0x03 — a love letter to forums Time goes on, technology advances, but when I was younger, I was captivated by forums.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t know the particulars of it, but there&amp;rsquo;s a strange sense of satisfaction in posting on a board and repeatedly refreshing the page until someone responds.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s something that nowadays technology has taken from us.&#xA;Why would people want to engage in a forum, create a post seeking assistance or initiating a discussion when they can go on Discord and get a response near instantly?</description>

      <description>0x02 —__always_inline, linux If you&amp;rsquo;re attempting to install a non-glibc Linux distribution using a Linux 5.X kernel, you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter this error while building the kernel.&#xA;/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h:44:8: error: unknown type name &#39;__always_inline&#39;&#xA;On a system running glibc, normally this isn&amp;rsquo;t an issue; __always_inline is defined. However, this is not the situation on most systems that utilize musl or other libc libraries.&#xA;So, as a quick fix, open up /usr/include/linux/swab.h in your flavor of text editor, and include linux/stddef.</description>

      <description>0x01 — Hello, World! This is my little corner of the internet, where I usually write whatever comes to my mind&amp;hellip; a little about me, the work I do, my system, etc.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m Senath, I go by Dragnosmz on the internet. I&amp;rsquo;m from Sri Lanka.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m quite obviously a programmer. I code some random things when I feel like it. Occasionally, I dabble in sysadmin stuff.&#xA;I remember spending (too) many hours on it watching YouTube, ricing, updating configurations, gaming and God knows what else.</description>

      <description>This place is where my scattered thoughts find solace, a sanctuary where I am both the artist and the canvas. It is a realm of silence, where my mind breathes freely, untethered. My words flow, unfiltered and true, like leaves drifting on a breeze, untouched by the world’s noise. Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Senath&#xA;I’m a 20y old guy from Sri Lanka. Sinhala is my native language. I like low-level programming and other computer stuff.</description>
