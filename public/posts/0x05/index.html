There’s something important I need to give my full attention to&hellip; something that’s been quietly building in the background for a while now. It’s not burnout, and it’s not goodbye&hellip; just a pause while I try to give this next chapter the space it deserves.<br>

<p>Before I go, here are a few lines from Hozier that have stuck with me —</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I clutched my life and wished it kept / My dearest love, I&rsquo;m not done yet<br>
How many years? I know I&rsquo;ll bear / I found something in the woods somewhere.”</em></p>
