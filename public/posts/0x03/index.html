<p>Time goes on, technology advances, but when I was younger, I was captivated by forums.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know the particulars of it,  but there&rsquo;s a strange sense of satisfaction in posting on a board and repeatedly refreshing the page until someone responds.<br>
That&rsquo;s something that nowadays technology has taken from us.</p>
<p>Why would people want to engage in a forum, create a post seeking assistance or initiating a discussion when they can go on Discord and get a response near instantly?<br>
Whether you prefer to call it patience, delayed gratification or something else, forums have a certain charm to them.</p>
<p>I do appreciate a good quick response from time to time, or a quick catch-up conversation with old friends over instant messaging,<br>
But I have a much larger appreciation for simple forums.</p>
<p>Within the forum community, it can be challenging to engage and attract individuals. It can be challenging to entice people to join in on something so primitive and outdated.<br>
Perhaps I am stuck in the past, but even today, I still enjoy browsing and sharing content on bulletin boards.</p>
<p>If you look hard enough,you might stumble upon forums that I&rsquo;m still an active keyboard warrior on.</p>
