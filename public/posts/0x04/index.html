<p>Sometimes in the *nix community, people will tell you things like &ldquo;systemd is bad&rdquo; and you shouldn&rsquo;t use it.<br>
After that, they will bandy reasons why systemd is considered to be problematic.</p>
<p>For any normal or informed user, some of the arguments against systemd may hold some validity.<br>
However, for users unfamiliar with nix, these are misleading justifications for not utilizing systemd.<br>
This blog entry is specifically targeted towards the latter crowd.</p>
<p>Systemd is often referred to as a &ldquo;software suite,&rdquo; which means it offers a wide range of tools. However, many of these tools are complex and require advanced knowledge to utilize effectively.<br>
None of systemd&rsquo;s components are inherently bad.</p>
<p>The problem with systemd is that the entirety of the software suite is executed as pid 1.<br>
The first process is the one that on many systems is the init system. It is the highest parent process in the hierarchy, as it is executed by the kernel.<br>
In certain scenarios, this is what you may desire. You may want a reliable and battle tested process running as the init, especially on servers.You might also consider having it on your desktop for convenience and accessibility.<br>
The thing is what works for others may not work for you.</p>
<p>People have asked me what init they should use. The simplest answer, use the one that works best for you. If systemd is compatible with your system, why switch it?<br>
On top of that, some Linux distributions hard depend on systemd. For example, <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>  where the entire system is built on the premise of using systemd. replacing it, while it can be done, is a quite annoying procedure.<br>
So all of this is to say: If you&rsquo;re a new user of nix and unsure about which init to use, it&rsquo;s best to stick with the default init.</p>
<p>To quote a friend of mine, <em>&ldquo;Linux users are all about freedom of choice, right up until someone&rsquo;s choice differs from theirs.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re the redpilled based user who is preaching to the newer, pure linux users:Shut up. Allow them to experience the advantages or disadvantages of the software themselves.
After all, Despite my dislike for systemd, it does get the job done.</p>
