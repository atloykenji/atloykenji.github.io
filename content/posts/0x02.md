# 0x02 â€”__always_inline, linux


If you're attempting to install a non-glibc Linux distribution using a Linux 5.X kernel, you'll encounter this error while building the kernel. 

```/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h:44:8: error: unknown type name '__always_inline'```  

On a system running glibc, normally this isn't an issue; __always_inline is defined.
However, this is not the situation on most systems that utilize musl or other libc libraries.  

So, as a quick fix, open up /usr/include/linux/swab.h in your flavor of text editor, and include linux/stddef.h just below linux/types.h.   

```#include <linux/types.h>```  
```#include <linux/stddef.h>```

With that, try to build again and you should be up an running.
Several PRs have been made regarding this matter, hopefully this will be fixed soon.
