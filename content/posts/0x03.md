# 0x03 â€” a love letter to forums


Time goes on, technology advances, but when I was younger, I was captivated by forums.   
I don't know the particulars of it,  but there's a strange sense of satisfaction in posting on a board and repeatedly refreshing the page until someone responds.  
That's something that nowadays technology has taken from us.  

Why would people want to engage in a forum, create a post seeking assistance or initiating a discussion when they can go on Discord and get a response near instantly?  
Whether you prefer to call it patience, delayed gratification or something else, forums have a certain charm to them.  

I do appreciate a good quick response from time to time, or a quick catch-up conversation with old friends over instant messaging,   
But I have a much larger appreciation for simple forums.  


Within the forum community, it can be challenging to engage and attract individuals. It can be challenging to entice people to join in on something so primitive and outdated.  
Perhaps I am stuck in the past, but even today, I still enjoy browsing and sharing content on bulletin boards.  

If you look hard enough,you might stumble upon forums that I'm still an active keyboard warrior on.
