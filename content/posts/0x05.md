# 0x05 — you won't see me for a year or two  

Just a quick note if you’ve been reading along, this has always been a personal blog. Lately, it's been all programming talk, but I’m feeling like it’s time to slow down and shift focus a bit
There’s something important I need to give my full attention to... something that’s been quietly building in the background for a while now. It’s not burnout, and it’s not goodbye... just a pause while I try to give this next chapter the space it deserves.  
Maybe I’ll have stories to tell when I’m back. We’ll see.  

Before I go, here are a few lines from Hozier that have stuck with me — 

_"I clutched my life and wished it kept / My dearest love, I'm not done yet   
How many years? I know I'll bear / I found something in the woods somewhere.”_
