# 0x01 â€” Hello, World!

  

This is my little corner of the internet, where I usually write whatever comes to my mind... a little about me, the work I do, my system, etc.

  

I'm Senath, I go by Dragnosmz on the internet. I'm from Sri Lanka.

I'm quite obviously a programmer. I code some random things when I feel like it. Occasionally, I dabble in sysadmin stuff.

  

I remember spending (too) many hours on it watching YouTube, ricing, updating configurations, gaming and God knows what else.
