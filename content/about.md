>####  _This place is where my scattered thoughts find solace, a sanctuary where I am both the artist and the canvas. It is a realm of silence, where my mind breathes freely, untethered. My words flow, unfiltered and true, like leaves drifting on a breeze, untouched by the world’s noise._

Hi, I'm Senath.  
I’m a 20y old guy from Sri Lanka. Sinhala is my native language.
I like low-level programming and other computer stuff.
Outside of coding, you’ll find me diving into math, music, playing video games, or lost in a good book. I’m passionate about open-source software and use GNU/Linux for nearly everything.
