Hi, I'm Senath.  
I’m a 20y old guy from Sri Lanka.
I like low-level programming and other computer stuff.
Outside of coding, you’ll find me diving into math, exploring music, or getting lost in a good book. I’m passionate about open-source software and I use GNU/Linux for nearly everything.
Occasionally, you’ll find me playing games on Steam
